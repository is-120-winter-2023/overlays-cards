## Hero overlay

Add a `<p>` as a subtitle to your site. Wrap your `<picture>`, `<h1>` and subtitle in a `<section>` with class `.hero`. Overlay your `<h1>` text and subtitle on top of your hero image using the `position` property. Use either a semi-transparent `background-color`, with or without a gradient or a `filter` to de-emphasize the image, and add a subtle text-shadow to your `<h1>` (and possibly your subtitle) to make it stand out. Don't set the font-size of `<h1>` yet. In the next section, you'll add dynamic font sizing to your `<h1>`.

![sample hero overlay](readme-assets/readme-hero-img.jpg)

Requirements for this section:

- A `<section>` with class `.hero` contains your `<picture>`, `<h1>` and a subtitle in a `<p>`.
- The `<h1>` and `<p>` are overlaid on your hero image using the `position` property ‚Äì you may group these with a `<div>`.
- Appropriate whitespace is used &ndash; adjust margins and font size so that `<h1>` and `<p>` "look good."
- The overlay uses a background gradient and/or the image has CSS filter added to de-emphasize the image.
- The `<h1>`, and optionally the subtitle, have a subtle text shadow to emphasize them.
- The overlay gradient or filter covers the entire image (no visible gaps)
- The text is positioned ‚Äì it does not have to be centered. Choose where you would like it to display. Flexbox will simplify positioning text, so don't spend time trying to perfectly position the text. At a minimum, it should at least be offset from the edge of the image.

## Dynamic font size

Use the `clamp()` function to dynamically size your `<h1>` font on your hero image.

| üé• Watch [Dynamic font sizing with CSS](https://youtu.be/veQoGy5DsQQ)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| This video shows how to use the `clamp()` function to set the font size of your `<h1>` so that it dynamically adjusts its font size so it readable on full screen, but not too big on tablet or mobile. `<br><br>` `<em>In the video I refer to</em>` `vw` `<em>` as "vertical width" but I meant "viewport width".</em>` |

Since you want only the `<h1>` on the hero image to dynamically resize, not the `<h1>` elements on other pages, using the hero class to target it specifically.

```css
.hero h1 {
  font-size: clamp(4rem, 7vw, 7rem);
}
```

_Don't just copy and paste the CSS above, rather figure out the best font sizes for your site._

| If you want to have more control over your font size using linear interpolation, read CSS Trick's [Linearly Scale font-size with CSS clamp() Based on the Viewport](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/). The article contains a tool to build the `clamp()` statement for you. <br><br>Another tool to generate a `clamp()` statement is [Adrian Bece's Modern fluid typography editor](https://modern-fluid-typography.vercel.app/). |

`clamp()` is not limited to fonts. You can use it to limit the maximum and minimum size on other elements as well. To learn more, read MDN's page on [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp). The page also compares `clamp()` to other useful functions such as `min()` and `max()`.

## Adding cards

Cards are ubiquitous on the internet. They are teasers, usually images and text, that are used to link to other pages or to provide additional information. They are often used to display a collection of items, such as a list of articles or blog posts or a list of products.

For this assignment, we will create four cards. Since we haven't learned layouts yet, don't worry so much if they don't look good on tablet or mobile. We will learn how to use a flexbox to make them responsive in a future assignment.

Below is a sample of some basic cards:

![sample cards](readme-assets/card-sample.jpg)

Before we start, we need to determine the maximum width needed for the images on our cards. For this assignment, we ignore [device pixel ratios](https://tomroth.com.au/dpr/) and will assume a maximum viewport width of 2000px. Therefore, the maximum width of our images is 500px or 2000px / 4.

**Crop all of your images to a width of 500px.**


| ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your cards all have the same aspect ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| To make your life easier, crop all your images so that they have the same width and height. Square images (1:1) are easiest to work with when you make your site responsive, but rectangular images are doable. Save your original (full-size) image files for use in a later assignment. |

Requirements for this section:

- Add a `<section>` with class `.cards` that will contain four cards. The section can be inside or outside `<main>`. _If it is inside main, its width will be limited by the `max-width` of main. If the cards are outside main, add a "gutter" of at least 1rem on the left and right to offset the cards from the edge of the screen_
- Add four cards, each with a unique image and text (text can either be always visible or appear on hover). You are welcome to model your cards after ones you've seen online or after some cards we reviewed in class.
- Card images are 500px wide. They can be any height, but should all be the same height. Make sure to add the `width` and `height` attributes to your `<img>` elements so that the browser can reserve space for the image before it loads.
- Images are responsive, in other words, they resize if the card resizes. This means their CSS width is set to 100%, which will cause them to always fill the width of their container. To override the height set in the `<img>` HTML, set the `height` property to `auto` in your CSS.

  ```css
  img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
  }
  ```

- Each card has its content wrapped in an `<a>`. The `<a>` element can be empty, meaning, you don't have to add an "href" or you can use `href="#"` which links to the top of the page - if it doesn't have an href, set the cursor to pointer.

Below is an example of markup for your cards. You are welcome to adjust it to suit your design.

```html
<section class="cards">
  <a href="#' class="card">
    <img src="" width="" height="" loading="lazy" alt="" />
    <p>card text</p>
  </a>

  ...

</section>
```

Since, by default, `<a>` elements are inline elements, you will need to set the `display` property of any `<a>` elements inside the `.cards` class to `inline-block` to make them behave like block elements. However, if you use a flexbox layout, you won't need to do this. To simplify this assignment, I recommend adding this to your CSS and not worrying about changing the `<a>` display property. We will learn more about how to use flexboxes in a future assignment.

```css
.cards {
  display: flex;
  ...;
}

.card {
  flex: 1 1 0;
  ...;
}
```

If you want spacing between the cards you can add gap:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  ...;
}
```

Adjust the margins, padding, font-size, and other properties to suit your design.

### Card hover effect

Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to add a hover effect to your cards. Use one of the examples from class, or one you like. In the image below, the leftmost card has a box-shadow appear on hover.

![sample card hover effect](readme-assets/card-sample-hover.jpg)

Add a transition to smooth the hover. The transition property is added to the element in its un-hovered state. The basic format is

```css
transition: property duration timing-function;
```

To transition the `box-shadow` property over 300 milliseconds, you would use

```css
.card {
  ...
  transition: box-shadow 300ms ease;
```

## :arrow_up: Commit your changes and sync the changes to Github

### Check for errors or warnings

Use Live Server to check that your site displays correctly and make sure that the VS Code status bar doesn't show any errors or warnings. When you are ready, commit your changes and sync them to Github.

### üöÄ Publish your web page on Github Pages

Open your repo on Github. Publish your site on GitHub pages.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Enter your repo about information

In your main repo page edit the About section. Enter a description of your repo and add your Pages URL in the **Website** text field.

## Validate your HTML with validator.nu

Once your page is live, use the [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) service to validate the HTML on all three of your web pages (main, contact, about). Select Show "outline" and "image report" then paste your page URL into the validator and click Check.

**NOTE**: Make sure to check that your `contact` and `about` pages also validate, not just your main page.

Check that your heading outline is in order and that each image has a valid `alt` attribute.

If you have any errors, fix them in VSCode, commit and sync, and then re-validate your page. Make sure to wait a few minutes for Github to generate the updated page.

## Pass automated tests

After you've ensured that your page has validated, open your repo in Github and check that you've passed the automated tests. If you haven't passed all of the tests, fix any errors and commit and sync your changes.

### Current automated tests

- HTML validation
- HTML proofer
